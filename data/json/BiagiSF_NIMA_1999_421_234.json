The calculated Lorentz angles are shown to be typically within 1\u00c2\u00b0 of the measured experimental values. The program allows the electric and magnetic fields to be at any angle to each other.", "bname": "BiagiSF_NIMA_1999_421_234", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "BIAGI1999234"}
