The double ratio thus suffers less systematic errors. Within the IBUU04 transport model the double neutron/proton ratio is shown to have about the same sensitivity to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy as the single neutron/proton ratio in the neutron-rich system involved. The double neutron/proton ratio is therefore more useful for further constraining the symmetry energy of neutron-rich matter.", "bname": "LiBaoan_PLB_2006_634_378", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "LI2006378"}
