Except possible phase transitions, the density dependence of nuclear symmetry {\\$} E{\\_}{\\{}{\\{}{$\\backslash$}rm sym{\\}}{\\}}({$\\backslash$}rho){\\$} is the most uncertain part of the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter especially at supra-saturation densities. Much progresses have been made in recent years in predicting the symmetry energy and understanding why it is still very uncertain using various microscopic nuclear many-body theories and phenomenological models. Simultaneously, significant progresses have also been made in probing the symmetry energy in both terrestrial nuclear laboratories and astrophysical observatories. In light of the GW170817 event as well as ongoing or planned nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations probing the EOS of dense neutron-rich matter, we review recent progresses and identify new challenges to the best knowledge we have on several selected topics critical for understanding astrophysical effects of the nuclear symmetry energy.", "da": "2019/07/25", "date-added": "2022-02-17 09:13:20 +0000", "date-modified": "2022-02-17 09:13:20 +0000", "doi": "10.1140/epja/i2019-12780-8", "id": "Li2019", "isbn": "1434-601X", "journal": ["The European Physical Journal A", "EPJA", "Eur.
