The nuclear h used in this work consists of a realistic two-nucleon interaction, called v14, that fits the available nucleon-nucleon scattering data up to 425 MeV, and a phenomenological three nucleon interaction adjusted to reproduce the empirical properties of symmetric nuclear matter. The variational many-body theory of symmetric nuclear matter is extended to treat matter with neutron excess. Numerical and analytic studies of the \u00ce\u00b2-dependence of various contributions to the nuclear matter energy show that at \u00cf\u00b1 < 0.35 fm\u00e2\u0088\u00923 the \u00ce\u00b24 terms are very small, and that the interaction energy EI(\u00cf\u0081, \u00ce\u00b2) defined as E(\u00cf\u0081, \u00ce\u00b2) \u00e2\u0088\u0092 TF(\u00cf\u0081, \u00ce\u00b2), where TF is the Fermi-gas energy, is well approximated by EI0(\u00cf\u00b1) + \u00ce\u00b22EI2(\u00cf\u0081). The calculated symmetry energy at equilibrium density is 30 MeV and it increases from 15 to 38 MeV as \u00cf\u00b1 increases from 0.05 to 0.35 fm\u00e2\u0088\u00923.", "bname": "LagarisIE_NPA_1981_369_470", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "LAGARIS1981470"}
