This is very important to describe neutron rich matter in astrophysics. This article reviews our knowledge of the symmetry energy from theoretical calculations, nuclear structure measurements, heavy-ion collisions, and astronomical observations. We then present a roadmap to make progress in areas of relevance to the symmetry energy that promotes collaboration between the astrophysics and the nuclear physics communities.", "bname": "HorowitzCJ_JPG_2014_41_093001", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "Horowitz_2014"}
