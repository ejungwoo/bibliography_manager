We report on a significantly improved version of GENFIT, based on experience gained in the Belle II, P\u00cc\u0084ANDA, and FOPI experiments. Improvements concern the implementation of additional track-fitting algorithms, enhanced implementations of Kalman fitters, enhanced visualization capabilities, and additional implementations of measurement types suited for various kinds of tracking detectors. The data model has been revised, allowing for efficient track merging, smoothing, residual calculation, alignment, and storage.", "bname": "RauchJohannes_JPCS_2015_608_012042", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "Rauch_2015"}
