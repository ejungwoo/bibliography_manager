Various multipolarities and strengths have been located between the excitation energies of 15 and 30 MeV. Isovector El states have been located at excitation energies between 20 and 30 MeV; E2 states at 15.3 and 18.4 MeV (T = 0); an E3 state at 21.65 MeV (T = 0); an E4 state at 19.6 MeV (T = 0); and a M2 state at 19.2 MeV (T = 1). The results are analyzed in terms of both collective and microscopic model calculations."}
