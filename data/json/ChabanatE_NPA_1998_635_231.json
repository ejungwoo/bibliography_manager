In this paper, these forces are specifically adjusted to reproduce finite nuclei properties. Spin-orbit terms and center of mass correlations are analyzed. New Skyrme parametrizations are proposed and some of their spectroscopic properties are presented, e.g. S2n, S2p and r.m.s. radii for different isotopic and isotonic series.", "bname": "ChabanatE_NPA_1998_635_231", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "CHABANAT1998231"}
