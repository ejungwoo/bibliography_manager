This newly formulated method of microscopic simulation of the heavy ion reaction can describe quantum mechanical features such as shell effects, since it treats the time development of the system wave function. We also propose a new prescription by which we can avoid the spurious zero-point energies of center-of-mass motion of fragment wave packets. The fragment production cross sections of the 12C + 12C reaction at 28.7 MeV/nucleon are analyzed by this new method. It is shown that the basic feature of the data including the large cross section of \u03b1-particle is reproduced well by the theory. Furthermore we show that the data are reproduced very well when we take into account the statistical cascade decays of the produced fragments, which verifies the great usefulness of the new microscopic simulation framework.", "\",\n    issn": "0033-068X", "doi": "10.1143/ptp/87.5.1185", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1143/ptp/87.5.1185", "eprint": "https://academic.oup.com/ptp/article-pdf/87/5/1185/5272175/87-5-1185.pdf", "bname": "OnoAkira_PTP_1992_87_1185", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "10.1143/ptp/87.5.1185"}
