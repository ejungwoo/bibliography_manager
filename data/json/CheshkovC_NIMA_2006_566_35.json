The algorithm is based on a \u201ccounting\u201d Hough-transform (HT) procedure. It combines a linear Hough transformation with fast filling of the HT parameter space. Both the track-reconstruction efficiency and the time performance of the algorithm have been evaluated showing its applicability for the reconstruction of PbPb events within the framework of the ALICE High-Level Trigger.", "bname": "CheshkovC_NIMA_2006_566_35", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "CHESHKOV200635"}
