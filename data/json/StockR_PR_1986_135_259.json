Emphasis is placed on recent progress in determining the equation of state of compressed fireball nuclear matter from the observed pion yield in central collisions. Further, the information derived from apparent spectral temperatures is critically examined, along with a discussion of thermal and chemical equilibrium attainment in the reactions, as revealed by particle spectra and yields.", "bname": "StockR_PR_1986_135_259", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "STOCK1986259"}
