Conceptual differences between statistical and dynamical approaches and the selection of experimental observables for identification of these processes are outlined. New and perspective developments, like inclusion of in-medium modifications of the properties of hot primary fragments, are discussed. We list important applications of statistical multifragmentation in other fields of research.", "da": "2006/10/17", "date-added": "2022-04-18 07:27:11 +0000", "date-modified": "2022-04-18 07:27:11 +0000", "doi": "10.1140/epja/i2005-10316-7", "id": "Botvina2006", "isbn": "1434-601X", "journal": ["The European Physical Journal A - Hadrons and Nuclei", "EPJA", "Eur.
