Its main tracking and particle-identification detector is a large volume Time Projection Chamber (TPC). The TPC has been designed to perform well in the high-track density environment created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this proceeding, we describe the track reconstruction procedure in ALICE. In particular, we focus on the two main challenges that were faced during the Run 2 data-taking period (2015&ndash;2018) of the LHC, which were the baseline fluctuations and the local space charge distortions in the TPC. We present the corresponding solutions in detail and describe the software tools that allowed us to circumvent these challenges.", "doi": "10.3390/particles5010008", "bname": "ArslandokMesut_Particles_2022_5_84", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "particles5010008"}
