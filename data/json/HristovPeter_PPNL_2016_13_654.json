The algorithm can also be used to perform track reconstruction; to estimate the trajectory of individual particles when passed through the active elements of a detector volume. This paper presents a fast reconstruction method for the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) of the ALICE experiment at LHC. The method, that combines a linear Hough Transform algorithm with a fast filling of the Hough Transform parameter space, is developed within AliceO2, the new computing framework of ALICE for RUN3.", "isbn": "1531", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1134/S1547477116050137", "doi": "10.1134/S1547477116050137", "name": "Kouzinopoulos2016"}
