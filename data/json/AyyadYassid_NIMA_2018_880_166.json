In this work, we have developed and implemented a novel algorithm based on the Random Sample Consensus Model (RANSAC). The RANSAC is used to classify tracks including pile-up, to remove uncorrelated noise hits, as well as to reconstruct the vertex of the reaction. The algorithm, developed within the Active Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC) framework, was tested and validated by analyzing the 4He+4He reaction. Results, performance and quality of the proposed algorithm are presented and discussed in detail.", "bname": "AyyadYassid_NIMA_2018_880_166", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "AYYAD2018166"}
