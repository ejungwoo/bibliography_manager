We show that the proper theoretical framework for these procedures is the theory of linear filtering, in particular the Kalman filter. Using results from filtering theory we confirm and extend the previous results. We also discuss the detection of outliers and of secondary vertices.", "bname": "FruhwirthR_NIMA_1987_262_444", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "FRUHWIRTH1987444"}
