I also review current work and results on the actual use of the first gravitational-wave observation of a neutron-star merger to set constraints on properties of such equation of state. In passing, I also touch on the possibility that what we observe in gravitational waves are not neutron stars, but something more exotic. In order to make this article more accessible, I also review the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission of neutron-star mergers in general, with focus on numerical simulations and on which representations of the equation of state are used for studies on binary systems.", "bname": "BaiottiLuca_PPNP_2019_109_103714", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "BAIOTTI2019103714"}
