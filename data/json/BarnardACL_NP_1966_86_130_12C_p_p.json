Complex phase shifts were obtained to represent the elastic scattering cross sections, the total inelastic cross sections and certain polarization data. The phase-shift values at the above discrete energies were used to estimate a continuous energy dependence for the phase shifts in the range 5.0 \u2266 Ep \u2266 9.5 MeV, omitting the rapid energy variation due to narrow levels. The estimates were varied slightly to obtain a good fit (except over the narrow levels) to the previously reported cross sections as a continuous function of energy. Finally the narrow levels were included in a calculation of the differential elastic scattering cross section, the total reaction cross section and the polarization at \u03b8lab = 50\u00b0, all as a continuous function of energy. The calculation adequately reproduced the experimental data through most of the energy range. Only one of the states close to Ep = 9.14 MeV was included in the calculations, so that the results differed significantly from the experimental values above Ep = 8.5 MeV.", "bcite": "A.
