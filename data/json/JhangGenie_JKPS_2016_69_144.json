In October 2015, the S$\\pi$RIT TPC was commissioned with 200 AMeV 79Se beams outside the SAMURAI dipole magnet. The experimental setup consists of the S$\\pi$RIT TPC, a Multiplicity Trigger Array, a KATANA array, and a Active Veto array. The TPC is fully equipped with a newly-developed read-out electronics system, GET electronics. The trigger logic to select events of the TPC based on the ancillary detectors was tested. The analysis software, SpiRITROOT, was developed to analyze the S$\\pi$RIT TPC data to determine the best trigger logic for upcoming experiments.", "volume": "69", "pages": "144--151", "page1": "144", "page2": "151", "issn": "0374-4884", "eissn": "1976-8524", "doi": "10.3938/jkps.69.144", "keywords": "\\#spirit", "bname": "JhangGenie_JKPS_2016_69_144", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "genie2016"}
