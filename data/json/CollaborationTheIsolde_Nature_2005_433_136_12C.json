This type of stellar nucleosynthesis is now recognized as the source of heavy elements in the Universe. Surprisingly there is still considerable uncertainty about the nature of the reaction that produces carbon-12. Fynbo et al. have now obtained a much more accurate measure of the reaction rate for carbon-12 synthesis than previously available, by measuring the reverse reaction rate. At temperatures found in young stars the new reaction rate is roughly twice the previous value, but at the 109 K found in supernovae, nucleosynthesis is much slower than was thought.", "isbn": "1476-4687", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03219", "doi": "10.1038/nature03219"}
