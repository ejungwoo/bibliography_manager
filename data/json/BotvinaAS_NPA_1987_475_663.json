We consider the principal equations of this model and the methods of solving them in the canonical and macrocanonical approximations. We then calculate the multifragment break-up of nuclei taking into account the de-excitation of hot fragments both by Fermi break-up and by evaporation of clusters. Finally, we analyze the main features of the multifragment break-up and compare them with those of the evaporation decay of highly excited nuclei.", "bname": "BotvinaAS_NPA_1987_475_663", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "BOTVINA1987663"}
