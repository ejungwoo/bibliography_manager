However, large differences (\u2248 200%) exist in the 12C(n, n+3\u03b1) cross section data of measurements and evaluations. Using a single crystal chemical vapor deposited (sCVD) diamond detector as an active target, cross sections of the 12C(n, n+3\u03b1) and 12C(n, \u03b10)9Be reactions were measured simultaneously in the neutron energy region of 9.50 \u2013 14.67 MeV. The present cross sections of the 12C(n,\u03b10)9Be reaction are consistent with the results of the latest measurement, which confirms the reliability of this work. The measurement results of the 12C(n, n+3\u03b1) reaction with uncertainties smaller than 15% contribute to effectively clarify the discrepancies of the measurements and evaluations. To our knowledge, this is the first time to measure the 12C(n, n+3\u03b1) cross sections using the diamond detector as an active target. Our method can be used in the future measurements to constrain the 12C(n, n+3\u03b1) excitation function in a much wider neutron energy region. R-matrix analysis was carried out for n+12C system using the RAC code in the neutron energy region below 30 MeV. Systematic and reliable calculation results are obtained for various reaction channels.", "bcite": "Jie Liu et. al., Phys. Lett. B 842 (2023) 137985"}
