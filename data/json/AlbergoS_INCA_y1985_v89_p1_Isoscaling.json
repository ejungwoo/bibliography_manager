All known data concerning the emission of2H,3H,3He,4He measured in a common experiment are used. These data refer to 19 heavy-ion reactions studied at projectile energies between 26 and 2100 MeV per nucleon. Analysed events are only those attributable to the equilibrium component through carefully adopted selections. Among the results, a correlation is observed between temperatureT and total free-nucleon density \u03f1tF of the emission source. A nuclear-matter model is formulated in order to compare its quantitative predictions with the observed (T, \u03f1tF) correlation. A good agreement is found by this comparison.", "date": "1985/09/01", "date-added": "2021-09-26 13:08:47 +0000", "date-modified": "2021-09-26 13:08:47 +0000", "doi": "10.1007/BF02773614", "id": "Albergo1985", "isbn": "1826-9869", "journal": ["Il Nuovo Cimento A (1965-1970)", "INCA", "Nuovo Cimento Soc.
