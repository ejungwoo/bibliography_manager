Initially, these outflows contain only protons and neutrons; these later combine to form \u03b1 particles, then 12C nuclei via the triple-\u03b1 reaction, and eventually heavier nuclei as the material expands and cools. Previous experimental work6,7 demonstrated that despite the high temperatures encountered in these environments, the reaction is dominated by the well characterized Hoyle state resonance in 12C nuclei. At sufficiently high nucleon densities, however, proton- and neutron-scattering processes may alter the effective width of the Hoyle state8,9. This raises the questions of what the reaction rate in supernova outflows is, and how changes affect nucleosynthesis predictions. Here we report that in proton-rich core-collapse supernova outflows, these hitherto neglected processes enhance the triple-\u03b1 reaction rate by up to an order of magnitude. The larger reaction rate suppresses the production of heavy proton-rich isotopes that are formed by the \u03bdp process3\u20135 (where \u03bd is the neutrino and p is the proton) in the innermost ejected material of supernovae10\u201313. Previous work on the rate enhancement mechanism9 did not anticipate the importance of this enhancement for proton-rich nucleosynthesis. Because the in-medium contribution to the triple-\u03b1 reaction rate must be present\u00a0at high densities, this effect needs to be included in supernova nucleosynthesis models. This enhancement also differs from earlier sensitivity studies that explored variations of the unenhanced rate by a constant factor1,2, because the enhancement depends on the evolving thermodynamic conditions. The resulting suppression of heavy-element nucleosynthesis for realistic conditions casts doubt on the \u03bdp process being the explanation for the anomalously high abundances of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru isotopes in the Solar System1,3,14 and for the signatures of early Universe element synthesis in the Ga\u2013Cd range found in the spectra of ancient metal-poor stars15\u201320.", "isbn": "1476-4687", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2948-7", "doi": "10.1038/s41586-020-2948-7"}
