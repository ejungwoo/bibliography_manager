The algorithm can also be used to perform track reconstruction; to estimate the trajectory of individual particles when passed through the active elements of a detector volume. This paper presents a fast reconstruction method for the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) of the ALICE experiment at LHC. The method, that combines a linear Hough Transform algorithm with a fast filling of the Hough Transform parameter space, is developed within AliceO2, the new computing framework of ALICE for RUN3.", "date": "2016/09/01", "date-added": "2023-09-18 17:23:40 +0900", "date-modified": "2023-09-18 17:23:40 +0900", "doi": "10.1134/S1547477116050137", "id": "Kouzinopoulos2016", "isbn": "1531-8567", "number": "5", "pages": "654--658", "page1": "654", "page2": "658", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1134/S1547477116050137", "volume": "13", "bdsk-url-1": "https://doi.org/10.1134/S1547477116050137", "bname": "KouzinopoulosCharalamposS_PPNL_2016_13_654", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "Kouzinopoulos:2016aa"}
