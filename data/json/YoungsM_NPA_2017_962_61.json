Two additional techniques, using an energy-averaged ratio and using the data present in the tail of energy spectra, are compared to the traditional method and show similar results. Isoscaling fit parameters \u00ce\u00b1 and \u00ce\u00b2 are found both globally and for each individual series of constant Z and N. The data are then split up between emitted fragments and projectile-like fragments. Isoscaling values for the two different types of fragments are shown to be different, emphasizing the importance of experimentally distinguishing between projectile-like fragments and emitted fragments in order to achieve accurate isoscaling parameters.", "bname": "YoungsM_NPA_2017_962_61", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "YOUNGS201761"}
