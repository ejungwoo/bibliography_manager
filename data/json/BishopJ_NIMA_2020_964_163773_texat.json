Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) offer a significant advantage over traditional charged-particle spectroscopy techniques due to a low-energy threshold and a high-geometric efficiency (\u22484\u03c0) which are essential for use with radioactive ion beams where the beam intensities are limited. The technique for high-sensitivity spectroscopy of \u03b2-delayed charged-particle emission is shown to be possible using the Texas Active Target (TexAT) TPC in conjunction with the General Electronics for TPCs (GET) system. The benchmark case studied was that of 12N \u03b2-decay to the first \u03b1-unbound state in 12C, the Hoyle state. Half-life and branching ratio measurements are presented and are in good agreement with previous studies. The efficacy of using TPCs to study such a near-threshold state and disentangle the three-body dynamics of the decay products is demonstrated."}
