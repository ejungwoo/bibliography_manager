We find that the extraction of useful information on the isospin-dependent part of the equation of state of nuclear matter from proton or neutron elliptic flows is obstructed by their sensitivity to model parameters and in-medium values of nucleon\u00e2\u0080\u0093nucleon cross-sections. Opposite to that, neutron\u00e2\u0080\u0093proton elliptic flow difference shows little dependence on those variables while its dependence on the isospin asymmetric EoS is enhanced, making it more suitable for a model independent constraining of the high-density behaviour of asy-EoS. Comparison with existing experimental FOPI-LAND neutron\u00e2\u0080\u0093hydrogen data can be used to set an upper limit to the softness of asy-EoS. Successful constraining of the asy-EoS via neutron\u00e2\u0080\u0093proton elliptic flow difference will require experimental data of higher accuracy than presently available.", "bname": "CozmaMD_PLB_2011_700_139", "bnumber": -1, "btype": "article", "btag": [""], "xname": "COZMA2011139"}
